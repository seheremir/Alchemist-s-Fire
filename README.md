# Alchemist's Fire

**Project Overview**  
I created this project for a school assignment. It’s a platform where I showcase the animated productions I’ve watched, providing details and insights about each one.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **HTML** - Structuring the content and layout of the page.
- **CSS** - Styling the website to make it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript** - Adding interactivity and dynamic features to enhance user experience.
- **MySQL** - Managing and storing data, such as information about the anime series.
